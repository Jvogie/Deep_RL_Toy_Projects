Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) in Robotic Simulations

This project involves training a reinforcement learning agent using the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm on various robotic simulation tasks provided by the panda-gym package. The goal is to teach a virtual robot to perform tasks such as reaching a point in space and picking and placing objects.
