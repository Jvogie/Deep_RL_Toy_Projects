Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) in Robotic Simulations

This project involves training a reinforcement learning agent using the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm on various robotic simulation tasks provided by the panda-gym package. The goal is to teach a virtual robot to perform tasks such as reaching a point in space and picking and placing objects.

Doom RL Training with Sample Factory

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates training a reinforcement learning agent in the "Doom" video game environment using the Sample Factory framework.

Features include:
- Training in the `doom_health_gathering_supreme` environment.
- Visualization of agent's performance post-training.
- Setup for ViZDoom engine and Sample Factory dependencies.
- Usage of custom neural network architecture for the Doom environment.
